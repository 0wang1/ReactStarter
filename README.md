# js-starter with react
Basically I created, using React, a component based note app. The "app" part of it serves as the parent to all other components of the actual app (such as the notes, the input bar, etc.) and it has all the information and decides what goes on in the webpage. The note and input bar are just components that feed information up to the app and know a few basic default attributes about themselves (as in they know a few things about their own state). Note for example just knows when to allow editing or gray out the textarea/changing the editing icons, and input bar only needs to know what is being typed into the bar (the state of the bar) so it can pass it up to App. Thus, they are technically smart, but app is just way smarter. App handles where the notes are, whether the notes are deleted or not, and the information in each note provided by the input bar. Everything turned out working as I thought it would, despite having next to no knowledge about React component coding beforehand (why is the syntax and functional programming aspect so different and confusing!!!). After getting the app to actually work (which should be EC in and of itself) I attempted to make it a little prettier (correct color, css styling, changing the sticky note to actually look like a sticky note with the buttons also switching out). Other than that I feel very happy with the product I created.
